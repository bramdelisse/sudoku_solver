# Simple Sudoku solver

Hobby thing I made on the plane trying to practice my vanilla python. My goal was to make it as simple and readable as possible in the shortest amount of time. I did not focus much on minimizing compute.

I'm aware this program can only solve up to ~6‚≠ê's because above that level you need more Sudoku tricks in order to find new numbers.

I know because my girlfriend is pretty good at sudoku's.
